Assembly Project: Student Grades Graph
Overview
This project involves building a system that creates a graph of students and their grades, starting from high-level code and translating it into assembly language. The graph represents student data visually, helping to analyze and compare grades. The project is based on the Mano Assembly Language.

Features
Student Data Input: Allows for the input of student names and their corresponding grades.
Grade Visualization: Generates a graphical representation of student grades.
Assembly Implementation: The high-level logic is translated into assembly, showcasing low-level programming techniques.
Technologies Used
Mano Assembly Language: For low-level programming and control.
High-Level Code: Initially written in a high-level language, which was then converted to assembly.
Project Structure
high_level_code/: Contains the initial high-level code before translation.
assembly_code/: Contains the assembly code after translation.
docs/: Documentation and explanation of the translation process.
